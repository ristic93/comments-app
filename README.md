# Comments-app

In order to make this app I worked with React.js & SASS used Vite.js as module bundler. Also worked with JWT token for authentication & HTTP request methods - GET, POST, PUT & DELETE for posting, editing and deleting comments.

## If you want to start the app:

1. Go to folder server and start the server first
2. Then go to folder client 
3. Type - npm run dev - in order to start the app
2. Then you will be able to register/log in to the app and make, edit or delete comments
